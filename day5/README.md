# Day 5 â€“ Migrated Login & Home Pages from JavaScript to TypeScript

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Completed
- Refactored `login.js` and `home.js` to `login.ts` and `home.ts`.
- Converted vanilla JS code to TypeScript with proper types.
- Added basic type safety for DOM elements (e.g., `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLElement`).
- Used interfaces where applicable for structured data.
- Ensured login and home logic works the same post-migration.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Basic TypeScript syntax: `type`, `interface`, `:string`, `:number`, etc.
- How to use `as` and type assertions for DOM elements.
- Handling optional chaining and type-safe conditionals with `Element | null`.
- Type-safe `localStorage` usage and redirection logic.

## ðŸ§° Stack
HTML, CSS, TypeScript

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Functionality remains unchanged; main goal was safe typing and migration.
- Improved readability and debugging confidence with TypeScript.
