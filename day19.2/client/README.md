🗕️ Day 19.2: Hands-on with GraphQL APIs

Practiced using a public GraphQL API (like https://countries.trevorblades.com or others).

Built a simple UI with:

An input to enter a name or country code.

Fetching user-related data (name, nationality, etc.) using GraphQL queries.

Used tools like:

Apollo Client or plain fetch with POST to /graphql endpoint.

Playground (GraphiQL or Apollo Sandbox) to test queries.
