# Day 3 â€“ Homepage with Redirection, Personalization & Subscription

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Completed
- Created a home page layout with navbar, hero section, and feature blocks.
- Implemented localStorage-based access control:
  - Redirected to login page if no email found in storage.
- Dynamically updated navbar button to show part of userâ€™s email.
- Added subscription input logic with basic alert confirmation.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to use `localStorage` to persist login state across pages.
- Redirection control using `window.location.href`.
- DOM manipulation to personalize content based on stored data.
- Handling button clicks and input values in JS.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Stored user email from previous login is sliced and shown on navbar.
- Subscription form shows an alert message confirming input.
- Page is accessible only after login â€” enforced via localStorage check.
