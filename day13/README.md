#### âœ… Day 13: Migrated Todo App to Ant Design (React + TS + Zustand)

ðŸ›  What I did:
- Refactored Day 12's custom Tailwind-based UI to use Ant Design components
- Integrated:
  - `Input`, `Select`, and `Button` components from AntD
  - `Splitter` layout from Ant Design Pro
- Used Zustand to manage state (tasks, completed, toggle, remove, delete)
- Added **priority-based task filtering** using dynamic buttons (All, High, Medium, Low)
- Styled with `.App.css` and inline AntD props where needed

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:
- Gained confidence in replacing custom CSS with Ant Design's ready-made, accessible UI
- Practiced lifting state up and creating dynamic filtered lists
- Discovered how `Select` and `Button` props work in Ant Design
- Explored layout composition using `Splitter.Panel` (vertical + horizontal layout magic)

ðŸ§  Reflection:
> This migration made me appreciate how fast you can build production-ready UIs with component libraries. Zustand + AntD is *chefâ€™s kiss* for simple apps.
