#### 🎨 Day 15: Dashboard UI Replication from Dribbble

🖼️ What I Did:
- Picked a clean and modern **dashboard UI** from Dribbble as reference
- Recreated the layout using **React + TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Matched typography, spacing, colors, and layout with high visual accuracy

🧠 What I Focused On:
- Practiced real-world UI replication from designer mockups
- Understood the visual hierarchy (cards, stats, navbars, sidebars)


🎯 Skills Sharpened:
- CSS alignment & spacing tricks using `flex`, `gap`, and grid
- Paying attention to **tiny design details** like shadows, border-radius, hover states, etc.

📌 Tools Used:
- 📦 `Tailwind CSS`
- 🧠 `Dribble` design inspiration (UI reference)

🛠️ Observations:
- Dribbble UIs are **pixel-perfect** — makes you appreciate front-end polish
- Matching layout isn’t just about the **structure**, it’s about the **feel**
- Great for understanding **design-to-code** translation
